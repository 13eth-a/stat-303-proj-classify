One of two final projects from STAT 303-3 (spring 2025). Goal is to utilize AirBNB data from three locations (Chicago, IL; Asheville, NC; Kauai, HI) to predict the categorization of new data as either being from hosts who are designated superhosts or not using classification model. Must have test ROC-AUC score of 0.970 or higher. Achieved a test ROC-AUC score of 0.9754 with this model.
